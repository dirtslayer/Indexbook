Why Indexbook?
==============

Native applications that run disconnected from the internet have an entirely different feel than web apps: they feel amazing. 

And a collection of files is a good start for a knowledge base, but to be a book, the files must have an order. 

Order is created by an index.

## Requirements

Get out of the way of disconnected tools:
- editors like ghostwriter
- graphics programs like krita
- version control agnostic
- easily searchable
- static view on web or pdf
- no build
- template mechanism
- HTML overrides
- Easy to maintain and order pages

## Inspiration

I was watching theprimeagens [DHH Is Right About Everything][1] 
and became inspired. Then I stumbled on Writebook, made 
by 37Signals, and I loved that it could make a book using markdown.

Going back to other attempts to organize my life, I drew on logseq,
which also used markdown and an org-mode like template system.

As I sit here writing this, I am inside a georgeous, responsive app:
Ghostwriter, this is where I want to write.

Pen and paper are still hard to beat for feel, but Krita is as close
as you'll find. 

Just like native apps, Indexbook hopes to ispire by getting out of your way.

Finally, I need to shout from the top of a mountain

Notes on Chrome Dev Tools
=========================
- ctrl+shift+i, add folder, allow access, esc console
- disable caching on network tab
- inspect the shadow dom (elements tab) with element inspector
  (dotted square with arrow inside)
- use element inspector, scroll the panel to see where 
  css values are comming from
- test on different size devices with device toolbar
- disable all your extensions to only get your own warnings
- there is no file menu, must use ctrl-s to save
- right click on refresh button to hard reload and empty cache

Why Indexbook?
==============

Native applications that run disconnected from the internet have an entirely different feel than web apps: they feel amazing. 

And a collection of files is a good start for a knowledge base, but to be a book, the files must have an order. 

Order is created by an index.

## Requirements

Get out of the way of disconnected tools:
- editors like ghostwriter, kate
- graphics programs like krita
- version control agnostic
- easily searchable
- static view on web or pdf
- no build
- template mechanism
- HTML overrides
- Easy to maintain and order pages

## Inspiration

I was watching theprimeagens [DHH Is Right About Everything][1] 
and became inspired. Then I stumbled on Writebook, made 
by 37Signals, and I loved that it could make a book using markdown.

Going back to other attempts to organize my life, I drew on logseq,
which also used markdown and an org-mode like template system.

As I sit here writing this, I am inside a georgeous, responsive app:
Ghostwriter, this is where I want to write for now.

Pen and paper are still hard to beat for feel, but Krita is as close
as you'll find.

Just like native apps, Indexbook hopes to inspire by getting out of your way.

Finally, I need to shout from the top of a mountain

## index.html

- the root document is a single page application that routes md files
  contained in descendant folders
- folders are analogous to chapters, which act as a way to
  organize the book. Also you could easily drop index.html anywhere you 
  want to make a book, including subfolders, making a book within a book
  (untested and weird)
- when index.html is served it has 2 parts, a contents section 
  (list of links to pages) and page preview section (thumbs)

> you do not need to modify index.html, just copy it into your document root
  

## index_include.md

- specifies order of the md files
- line separated values / list of files
- created by author, or generated by script

> you need to maintain index_include.md, files not listed here are allowed but
  will not be included in the book
  

## Markdown Files

- Each chapter is in a folder with md files

- This repository is an Indexbook sample with the following chapters
    - the indexbook manual
    - my notes
    - personal journal sample
    
- You can use html inside a markdown, but there is one important caveat:

> Anything inside a html div will not be processed by markedjs's url rewriter.
  As a result urls inside html blocks need to be relative to index.html, not
  the folder they are in. For example, the cover of The_Indexbook_Manual uses
  css to center the image. The src url of that image now must include the folder.
  After using adjusting you will not be able to use a wysiwig editor, and once
  you switch to html that also becomes an issue too. So, paths inside html blocks
  have to be relative to index.html ie. (/The_Indexbook_Manual/media/image.jpg)
  instead of (./media/image.jpg)

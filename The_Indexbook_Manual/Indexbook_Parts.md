# Indexbook Parts

## index.html

- the root document is a single page application that routes md files
  into a a list of links (contents) and a list of page previews (thumbs)

- you do not need to modify this file, just drop it into your document root

## index_include.md

- specifies order of the md files
- line separated values / list of files
- created by author, or generated by script

## Markdown Files

- Each chapter is in a folder with md files
- This repository is an Indexbook sample:
    - this manual
    - example personal journal
    - krita for notes
        
## Journal Module
- templated using minimal nushell script
- date based entry name creation

> Hint: Use [ctrl scrollwheel] [ctrl +] and [ctrl -] to scale page thumbnails
